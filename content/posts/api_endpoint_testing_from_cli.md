### Postman tests themselves
### Installing Newman (where to install?)
* I installed it globally on my machine
### Configure Newman
* I will be running my test collection against a local instance of my app
* Github will be running my test collection against a github hosted instance of my app
* So how do I alter my test collection so I can use different domains?
* I guess I need to use environment variables
### Getting all my tests to run properly
### Next steps? (Using newman with github actions)

### Resources:
* [Postman Newman CLI tool docs](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/)
