Intro Notes:

 — With Sapiens, Yuval became popular with the Tech community. Now with this book it seems he is utilizing his access to this influential audience to deliver a warning about how their work (if continued without reflection) could leads us to a bleak future. 

Chapter Notes:

*   The Anthroprocene: 

 — Humans have come to dominate Earth.

*   The Human Spark:

— Why have humans dominated Earth? The soul? Consciousness? Intelligence? Tool production?

 — For many millennia humans believed the soul made humans special, making them superior to other organisms on Earth.

 — However, no one has been able to define or find the soul nor have we proven other organisms lack it.

 — Consciousness = subjective experiences (sensations, emotions, and thoughts mingled together that we experience in a flowing manner). Science has shown animals have subjective experiences, but maybe these are unconscious biochemical algorithms different from what humans experience? Although there is no conclusive evidence, brains scans have shown that many animal brains exhibit behavior that suggests conscious states…the Cambridge Declaration of Consciousness signed by experts neurobiology and cognitive sciences demonstrates how unlikely it is that humans are the only conscious organism on Earth, so there must be something else that makes us dominant…

 — Humans have been the most intelligent / most masterful tool producers on the plant for over a million years, but haven’t become significant until the last dozen millennia.

 — So why have humans become so dominant?…

 — Humans ability to cooperate flexibly and on a large scale is what sets humans apart from other organisms on Earth. 

 — Humans can cooperate flexibly because they can ‘quickly’ redefine the nature of their cooperation. Some animals like chimps can cooperate flexibly, but only on a small scale. Humans can cooperate flexibly and on a large scale with complete strangers, which is unique. 

 — If cooperation is the human spark, the cause of humans domination on Earth, then it makes much less sense to sanctify individual humans…there is no special attribute that sets individual humans apart. 

 — Shared beliefs and stories are what allows humans to cooperate flexibly at scale. Humans derive individual meaning from shared beliefs and stories which drives cooperation. Yuval divides reality into the objective, the subjective and the intersubjective. Shared beliefs and stories made up by humans to facilitate cooperation are intersubjective entities. (Revisit these ideas from 167 — 177pg)

*   The Story Tellers

 — At first, 70,000 BC, when humans developed the ability to speak (Cognitive Revolution) they shared stories and beliefs on a small scale. Cooperation was limited by hunting / gathering which could not support population density. 

— Then, 12,000 BC, agriculture allowed for more population density and cooperation on a larger scale, but further growth was limited by the ability to share complex stories over large distances and with large groups. All knowledge had to be stored in human brains, making organizing large scale cooperation impossible. 

 — In, 5000 BC, writing systems allowed us to dramatically expand the scale of cooperation.
