# A list of Linux commands I have used recently

### Tar: for extracting contents of a .zip archive
* options:
    * -x, extract to disk from archive
    * v, verbose mode
    * f, read the archive from the specified file (can be used to write as well).

### man: navigating man pages more quickly
* commands:
    * h, opens a help menu of all the glorious commands that make man easier to use
    * f, move forward one page
    * b, move backwards one page
    * j, move forward one line
    * y, move backward one line
* notes:
    * there are a few different keys and combinations that map to these navigation functions
    * all these commands can take a number (number + key_stroke), which allows for more pages/lines jumps
