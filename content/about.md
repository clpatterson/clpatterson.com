I'm a Brooklyn, NY based Software Engineer and Mandarin speaker. I've scraped the Chinese web for [Asia Society](https://asiasociety.org/center-us-china-relations/about), helped setup data warehouses on Google Cloud and lead Looker deployments as a data engineer consultant at [Myers-Holum](https://www.myersholum.com/practices/edw-cloud-migrations/), and now I'm at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) becoming a better programmer. When I'm not programming, I'm biking around the five bouroughs, reading, road tripping, and camping.
