I'm a programmer based in Berkeley, California. I've been at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) for 4 years building seller tools. Before Etsy, I spent time building side projects and learning to be a better programmer at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a fantastic community of curious programmers.

I got my start programming by automating some of my work at an ad agency in New York, then I scraped the Chinese web for [Asia Society](https://asiasociety.org/center-us-china-relations/about) as a contractor, and helped setup data warehouses on Google Cloud and led Looker deployments as a data engineer consultant at [Myers-Holum](https://www.myersholum.com/practices/edw-cloud-migrations/). I'm self taught and have always benefited from the wisdom and mentoring of other programmers around me.
