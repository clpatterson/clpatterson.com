title: Computing People Map
---
My own topology of people in the programming field that I find interesting. It's a reminder that programmers can take many shapes and no one knows everything. There isn't any order to this map yet.

#### Julia Evans
- I'm a fan of her [blog](https://jvns.ca/) and [zines](https://wizardzines.com/). I reread the debugging zine a lot.

#### Steve Yegge
- Learned about [Steve Yegge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Yegge) via the [*Pragmatic Engineer* podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZE33qMYwsc).
- Listened to his [famous platform rant blog post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDdkc_RwKYI).
- Steve built [Grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Kythe#:~:text=Apache%20licence%202.0.-,Grok,-%5Bedit%5D), a large-scale, cross-language source analysis tool at google and gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTJs-0EInW8) about it. (Still working my way through the talk.)
- Eventually want to check out his old blog posts [here](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/home) and [here](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/) and [here](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/).

#### Gergely Orosz (gair-gay or-oh-ss)
- Author of the *[Pragmatic Engineer blog](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/)* and podcast. 
- Great interviewer. Great at navigating hype and collecting different perspectives on emerging technologies like gen AI.
