Four weeks of (Virtual) Recurse Center will have pasted Friday. How has the experience been so far? Am I getting the most out of RC? What have I done? How have I done it? How could things be better or worse?

What have I accomplished at RC so far?

*   Added a cli interface to my recursive BigQuery table parser utility.
*   Completed OOP style TicTacToe, got a code review, and implemented the feedback.
*   Completed Conway’s Game of Life…yet to be submitted for a code review…
*   Read about stacks and begin reading about queues in my data structures and algorithms book.
*   Completed a handful of Python challenges on Codewars and leveled up from 8 kyu to 7 kyu.
*   Completed my first Leet Code challenge and then improved my solution.

What else have I accomplished?

*   I’ve been navigating my learning in a thorough way. I have read quite a few articles on RealPython, GeeksforGeeks, and W3schools whenever I don’t understand my code or want to solidify my understanding of Python.
*   I have produced copious notes for myself in a series called “What I know about Python <topic>.” In this series, I take notes on things I’m using and learning as I code. So far I have notes on standard library modules/functions, ecosystem modules/functions, built-in functions, operators, data structures, and looping constructs.
*   I gave my first technical talk on Python list comprehensions.
*   I’ve had coffee chats with Recursers almost every day.
*   I’ve attended different RC groups and events and done a decent job of balancing my learning with staying involved in the community (though I do wonder if I’m striking the right balance from time to time…but this seems typical for people in batch.)
*   Began assembling notes on Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI) and things I can do to prevent them.

What am I doing well?

*   I’m making consistent progress on my projects and learning goals (even if some days are more productive than others).
*   I’m getting back into productive procrastinating (a skill I honed in college, but seem to have forgotten) where I shift to another task on my list when I can’t find the motivation to work on what I “should be working on”.
*   I’m participating in the community on Zulip, but not being distracted by it.
*   I’m doing a decent job of balancing RC and my relationship.
*   Cooking healthy meals, keeping the apartment neat, assembling furniture, keeping up with friends and family, organizing/participating in socially distanced (read mostly digital) events with friends.
*   Reading and listening to books more than I’m watching tv.
*   Going outside and taking breaks when I feel myself being unproductive.

What I could improve upon?

*   There are certainly things I could improve upon. But now that I have reached this section, I don’t really feel like listing or thinking about these. I’ve been cooped up for over a month now and I’m feeling good about how I’ve adapted.

Till next time.
