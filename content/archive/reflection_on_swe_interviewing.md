# Intro

I wrapped up my "first" software engineering job search recently and before I begin work,
I want to reflect on the experience. I'm going to break down my thoughts into sections––
technical aspects of the process and emotional aspects.

# Initial Approach

## Technical

- What technical material did I set out to learn for interviewing?
  - I decided to focus mostly on learning and practicing data structures and algorithms, with little
    time devoted to learning about system design interviews. I made this calculation because, from
    what I'd heard, system design interview performance is less important for entry level candidates.
- What was my initial approach to learning data structures and algorithms?
  - I started by working through Problem Solving with Data Structures and Algorithms, an interactive
    introductory textbook that covers all fundimental data structures and algorithms knowledge. I figured
    I would work through the textbook first, taking notes and preparing a study guide.

* Along the way I signed up for InterviewCake and begin working through all the articles on data structures
  and algorithms. I did this mostly because other engineers at Recurse Center like the site for its simple
  and easy to follow explainations.
  - After completing the textbook, I planned to work through practice problems on Leetcode to further master the
    material, gain exposure to interview questions, and prepare for the challenge of live coding.

## Emotional

- What did it feel like as I started preparing for technical interviews?
- When did I decide to start interviewing? Why then?
- How did my initial approach make me feel? Was it easy to stay motivated and build momentum?
