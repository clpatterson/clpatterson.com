### Typing Form:
* Remember to strike keys softly.
    * Using only the force needed to yeild a letter is good technique. Hard strikes cause the key to travel all the way to the plastic base of the keyboard sending the force back into your finger. Over time this can cause damage and pain.
* Middle Instead of Index Finger for "4" key:
    * [Typist](https://www.typesy.com/11e/?utm_expid=.b-dKnk0ITSechrqnLCSNnw.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.typesy.com%2Findividuals-10k%2F) teaches users to strike the "4" key with their index finger, however this movement causes me to bend my wrist inwards when I reach for the key. I know from reading about RSI that keeping straight wrists is important for preventing pain from typing, so this isn't viable technique for me. Instead, reaching up with my middle finger seems natural and doesn't cause me to bend my wrist, so I'm going to try that out in my next lesson.
* Moving left hand for "b" key:
    * Striking the "b" key with my index finger causes me to reach and stretch in an uncomfortable way, so moving my whole hand down to strike the key with my index finger is a much better idea.
* Moving my left hand for the left "shift" key
    * When I strike the left shift with my pinkie finger it causes ulnar deviation in my left hand
    * A better approach is to move my hand off the home row and strike that key with my ring finger
* Keeping wrists straight and level 
    * I find even when I'm keeping my wrists off my desk I still slouch causing dorsiflexion
    * I also find that even with a split keyboard my wrists still want to come together causing ulnar deviation out of habbit
    * I want to be more aware and focus on correcting these habits as I relearn to type

### Practice:
* Using a typing program, regularly practice using RSI friendly technique

### Physical Training:
* Regular exercise is crucial for the prevention of RSI
* Train your fingers 3 times a week
    * Using a rubber band for finger strength training exercises is really helpful for reducing pains and aching from RSI.
